Below is a refined plan based on your clarifications:

Overall Concept

We will build a minimalist two-panel diff viewer where:
	•	Left Panel (Primary File):
	•	Shows the “master” file with line numbers.
	•	Uses pale orange background highlights for matching portions.
	•	If a given line belongs to a single highlight, that line’s background is uniformly highlighted.
	•	If a line (or a group of consecutive lines) is covered by more than one highlight, the background remains pale orange but a margin (next to the line numbers) shows stacked vertical bars—one per overlapping highlight.
	•	Each vertical bar uses a distinct (pale) color and has a hover effect that can display extra information (like an identifier or details about the highlight).
	•	Right Panel (Matching File):
	•	Provides a selector (e.g., dropdown) at the top to choose among several matching files (e.g., files crawled from the Internet).
	•	Displays the file content with the same pale orange highlight on the corresponding lines if they are marked in the left file.
	•	Since we assume that any highlight in the left should appear in the right, the right panel simply applies a uniform pale orange background without any stacked bars.

1. HTML Structure

A. Layout Container
	•	Create a top-level container (e.g., a <div id="app">) that uses Flexbox or CSS Grid to place two panels side by side.

B. Left Panel (Primary File)
	•	Container: <div id="left-panel">
	•	Line Numbers & Margin:
	•	A fixed-width column that shows the line number for each line.
	•	Adjacent to the line numbers, reserve a “margin” area where vertical bars will appear when needed.
	•	Content Area:
	•	A <pre> or series of <div> elements for each line (or group of lines) that display the file text.
	•	Each line or block will get classes based on its highlight state (single highlight vs. overlapping highlights).

C. Right Panel (Matching File)
	•	Container: <div id="right-panel">
	•	File Selector:
	•	A <select> dropdown (or a list of buttons) to choose the matching file.
	•	Content Area:
	•	Similar to the left panel, using a <pre> or series of <div> elements for each line of text.
	•	Highlights are applied by adding a CSS class that sets a pale orange background.

2. CSS Styling

A. General Layout
	•	Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to align the two panels.
	•	Ensure a clean, minimalist style with ample whitespace and a monospaced font for the file text.

B. Line Numbers & Content Areas
	•	Line Numbers Column:
	•	Fixed width, right-aligned.
	•	Text Content:
	•	Monospaced font and consistent line height.

C. Highlighting Styles
	•	Standard Highlight (Single, Non-overlapping):
	•	A CSS class (e.g., .highlight) that applies a pale orange background color.
	•	This class will be used both in the left panel (when no overlap) and in the right panel.
	•	Overlapping Highlights (Left Panel Only):
	•	For lines with overlapping highlights, still apply the pale orange background to the text.
	•	In the margin next to the line numbers, create vertical bars:
	•	Each bar is a small <div> or <span> with a fixed width (e.g., 4–6px) and height matching the line.
	•	Use a CSS class (e.g., .overlap-bar) with modifiers (like .bar-1, .bar-2, etc.) or inline styles for different pale colors.
	•	Add a :hover effect that shows a tooltip or highlights additional info about the highlight.
	•	The bars should be “stacked” vertically (or horizontally, side by side) depending on your design. For example, if stacking horizontally next to the line number, they should appear in the order they occur.

D. Additional Colors
	•	Prepare a small palette of pale colors for the vertical bars and, if needed, for alternative highlight backgrounds.

3. JavaScript Functionality

A. Data Structure
	•	File Content:
	•	Represent each file as an array of lines (or objects with line number and text).
	•	Highlight Data:
	•	Use objects with properties like { startLine, endLine, id, color } (color can be chosen from your pale palette).
	•	Hard-code sample highlight data for the proof of concept.
	•	For the left file, some lines (or ranges) will have a single highlight, and some will have multiple (overlapping) highlights.

B. Overlap Detection & Rendering (Left Panel)
	•	Detection:
	•	Loop through the file’s lines. For each line, check which highlight objects apply (i.e., where startLine <= currentLine <= endLine).
	•	Rendering Decision:
	•	Single Highlight:
	•	Apply the .highlight class to the line’s text.
	•	Multiple Highlights:
	•	Apply the .highlight class to the text (so the background remains pale orange).
	•	Instead of a full background highlight, render in the margin a series of vertical bar elements:
	•	Create one bar per overlapping highlight.
	•	Apply different classes or inline styles for their colors.
	•	Attach hover event listeners so that when a user hovers over a bar, extra information (e.g., a tooltip) appears.

C. Right Panel Rendering
	•	File Selection:
	•	Populate the file selector with the list of matching files.
	•	On selection change, load the corresponding file (hard-coded sample data).
	•	Highlight Rendering:
	•	For every line, check if it corresponds to a highlight from the left.
	•	If yes, add the .highlight class to that line’s container.
	•	No need to check for overlaps here—the right panel always uses a uniform pale orange background.

D. Event Handling
	•	File Selector:
	•	Listen for change events to re-render the right panel’s file content.
	•	Hover Effects on Bars:
	•	Add mouseenter and mouseleave events to vertical bar elements to show/hide tooltips or change styling.

4. File Organization
	•	index.html:
	•	Contains the basic HTML structure for the two panels and the file selector.
	•	styles.css:
	•	Contains all CSS rules for layout, fonts, line numbers, background highlights, vertical bars, and hover effects.
	•	main.js:
	•	Contains the logic for loading files, processing highlight data, detecting overlaps, and handling interactions (file selection, hover events).

User Flow Summary
	1.	Page Load:
	•	The left panel shows your primary file with line numbers.
	•	For each line:
	•	If it is covered by one highlight, the entire line gets a pale orange background.
	•	If it is covered by two or more highlights, the line background remains pale orange and the margin next to the line number displays stacked vertical bars (each with a distinct pale color). Hovering over these bars will display additional details.
	2.	Right Panel Interaction:
	•	A file selector (dropdown or button list) allows the user to choose among matching files.
	•	The selected file is displayed with a pale orange highlight on the same portions as in the left file.
	•	Because the left file drives the highlighting (to indicate plagiarism matches), any highlighted region in the left is mirrored in the right.
	3.	Interactivity:
	•	Hovering over any vertical bar in the left panel shows a tooltip or some extra info about that highlight.
	•	The overall UI remains minimalist, focusing on the highlighting and matching diff features.

This plan should cover your requirements for a proof-of-concept demo of matching diff with sophisticated highlighting (including overlapping handling on the left and a consistent pale orange highlight on the right) along with file selection and hover effects on the vertical bars.
